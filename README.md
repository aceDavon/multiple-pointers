# Multiple Pointers
This repo is part of a group of repos created to practice Algorithm and Data structures with automated workflows and tests

Challenge Statement:
write a function that accepts an array of numbers so that if the sum of 2 numbers of the array equals zero, return a new array containing the 2 numbers whose sum equals 0

e.g ([-4, -2, -1, 0, 1]) returns [-1, 1];
